# PR Review Exercise

A client has tasked you with creating a responsive and highly performant listing of cats. They already have some code from a contractor that they had previously hired to do it.

You have been given half done code that will need to be cleaned up and further optimized.

You will be assessed on how well you can spot and correct issues with this code, as well as, your work in cleaning it up and optimizing it further.

Go to snack.expo.dev -> then import this repository.

Good luck!
